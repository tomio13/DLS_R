[Dynamic light scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_light_scattering) or photon correlation spectroscopy is a well established experimental tool to analyze particle sizes in diluted suspensions.

The most common analysis assumes a monodisperse particle size distribution and particles freely diffusing in a Newtonian fluid like water.
The analysis also requires the knowledge of:
- wavelength of the scattered laser light (e.g. 632.8 nm for a HeNe laser)
- the material of the medium, especially its
  - viscosity (in mPas or cP)
  - its refractive index
- the temperature (which also influcences the above parameters of the medium)

Most commonly we assume using spherical hard particles thus we can employ the Stokes - Einstein relation to get a hydrodynamic radius of the diffusing particles from the time fluctuation characteristics of the scattered intensity.
The process is assumed to be elastic scattering, where the wavelength of scattered light did not change in the process.
